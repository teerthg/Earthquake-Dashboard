# Earthquake Dashboard

This project involves creating an interactive **Earthquake Dashboard** using **Power BI**. The dashboard visualizes earthquake data from various sources, providing insights on total earthquakes, their magnitude, depth, and occurrence over time. The visualizations are designed to help users quickly analyze earthquake trends and relationships between different attributes, such as depth and magnitude.

## Features:
- **Total Earthquakes**: Displays the total count of earthquakes in the dataset.
- **Total Earthquakes by Magnitude**: A histogram visualizing the frequency of earthquakes by their magnitude.
- **Total Earthquakes by Month**: A bar chart showing the number of earthquakes by month.
- **Depth and Magnitude Relationship**: A scatter plot that visualizes the correlation between depth and magnitude of earthquakes.
- **Depth Histogram**: A histogram to understand the distribution of earthquake depths.
- **Total Earthquakes by Year**: A line chart showing the number of earthquakes by year.

## Dataset:
The dataset used for this dashboard includes earthquake information from multiple years, including the following key columns:
- **Magnitude**: The magnitude of the earthquake on the Richter scale.
- **Depth**: The depth of the earthquake in kilometers.
- **Date**: The date when the earthquake occurred.
- **Location**: The geographical region where the earthquake was detected.

## Power BI Visualizations:
- **Bar Charts**: Used for visualizing earthquake counts by month, year, and magnitude.
- **Scatter Plot**: Used to show the relationship between depth and magnitude.
- **Map**: Geographical visualization of earthquake locations by region.
- **Line Chart**: Used to analyze trends in earthquake occurrence over time.
